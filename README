This project is a simple expenses tracker that works as a web application which you can access through your browser.

Currently the project is writen in Greek language but translations are coming.

It is built using PHP and Javascript and requires a MySQL database and a Web server.
It has been successfully tested on a LAMP environment.

To install create a new user and a new DB in MySQL and import expenses.sql.
Place all files from expenses folder in your web servers root.
Open index.php with your favorite editor and change the DB connection settings.
Now you are ready to go!

To use the application just point your browser to where you have installed it.
Usage is pretty self explanatory.

TODO:

English Translation
User defined expense categories
Perhaps a fancier interface
Other translations if requested (and language files provided)
